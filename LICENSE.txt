NOTE if you are using the Stanford models for NLP related tasks:
“Stanford CoreNLP is licensed under the GNU General Public License (v3
or later; in general Stanford NLP code is GPL v2+, but CoreNLP uses
several Apache-licensed libraries, and so the composite is v3+). Note that
the license is the full GPL, which allows many free uses, but not its use
in proprietary software which is distributed to others. For distributors of
proprietary software, CoreNLP is also available from Stanford under a
commercial licensing You can contact us at java-nlp-support@lists.stanford.edu.
If you don’t need a commercial license, but would like to support maintenance
of these tools, we welcome gift funding: use this form and write “Stanford NLP
Group open source software” in the Special Instructions.”
