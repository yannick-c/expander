def expand_contractions(stanford_model, sent_list, is_split=True):
    """
    This method uses the StanfordPOSTagger tags to identify contractions in
    the sentence and expand them sensibly. Some examples are:
        "I'm" -> "I am"
        "It's difficult" -> "It is difficult"
    The difficulty is that sometimes "'s" is not an indicator of a
    contraction but a possessive pronoun like
        "It's legs were shaking"
    which should not be expanded. The stanford tagger tags this as
    "POSS" for possessive which makes it easy to identify these cases.
    Furthermore, a difficulty lies in the fact that the expansion is not
    unique. Without context we have for example the following:
        "I'll" -> "I will" or "I shall"

    Args:
        stanford_model - object of StanfordPOSTagger, as returned by
                         load_stanford_pos.
        sent_list - list of sentences which are split up by word.
                    For the splitting use nltk.word_tokenize.
        is_split - boolean to track whether splitting has to be done
                   or not. If it has to be done provide sentences as
                   single strings.

    Returns:
        sent_list with expanded contractions.
